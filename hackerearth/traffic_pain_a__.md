Traffic is a pain in the A**


Mr Prabhu is a very busy businessman. He has a lot of work to do in his day to day life like attending meetings, talking to clients, etc. He makes on an average of $2500 every hour.

He travels in a Mercedes Benz everyday with his driver driving through the roads, taking him from his home to his workplace and back again. He spends exactly 3 hours on the road every single day when there is traffic, and when there is no traffic, he spends only 1 hour on the road.

Your job is to calculate the monthly loss he makes while traveling to his workplace when there is traffic, assuming that the number of days there would be traffic would be decided by the probability P, i.e. if the number of days in a month is 30 and probability is 0.3, then the number of days there would be traffic would be 9. You must also display the number of days there would be traffic in that month.

INPUT: N (integer) : number of test cases. M (integer) : which month is chosen. P (floating point) : Probability of traffic in a month.

OUTPUT: D : Number of traffic filled days. L : Loss incurred.

Input explanation

2 : number of test cases

4 : month number(April)

0.5 : Probability

5 : month number(May)

0.8 : Probability

Output Explanation

15 : no. of days traffic would be present

112500 : Loss incurred (300.52500*3)

24.8 : no. of days traffic would be present

186000 : Loss incurred (310.82500*3)


HINTS

February has 28 days only. Output should be in integer type only ! (convert data type explicitly after calculation of the loss incurred) Calculate loss only during traffic days.
