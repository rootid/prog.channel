//in lrucache elements accessed recently will have high priority
//than the other elements

//operations of LRU cache 
1.Remove/evict the least used page
2.set/update the page location head/tail based on the access
3.insert the page if not available.

capacity = 2
set(2,1)
set(2,2)
get(2)
set(1,1)
set(4,1)
get(2)

NOTE 2 things 
1.LRU : least recently used
    2 Underlying data structures
    1.DLL : 1. Easy to move the node to the front i.e. node that accessed recently ( Move the node in O(1) time )
            2. Easy to check the capacity and accrodingly delete the node at the tail position
    2.unordered_map : result in get operation O(1) time

2.LFU : least frequently used
